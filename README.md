# Spartan-Program
Spartan Program website

DUE TO ISSUES WITH GITHUB MAIN, MY CLASS FINAL PROJECT IS STORED IN THE MASTER BRANCH. 
PLEASE USE THE MASTER BRANCH REPO FOR THE FINAL EVALUATION

My site is focused on the Spartan program from the Halo series. I have added visual aids, 
site links to the studios that made it and information about the Spartan program. 
The site is designed to read like a Office of Naval Intellgience document.

CSS Feature 
For my project I used the “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on my web page. 

Javascript
Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. 

Media Queries 
I designed two media queries for both desktop/larger screens, abd  medium screens like tablets.
