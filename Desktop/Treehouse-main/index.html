        <p>
          The SPARTAN-II Program, originally known as the ORION Project 
            Generation II, was part of the SPARTAN Program, an effort to produce 
            elite soldiers through mechanical and biological augmentation. 
            The SPARTAN-II program would be the first in the series to meld 
            advanced exoskeleton technology with the soldiers' superior physiques.

        <h3>Spartan Training</h3>
        <p>
          The SPARTAN-II candidates, after being abducted and sedated, were taken 
          to the colony world Reach, and began their training under Chief Petty 
          Officer Mendez. The SPARTANs endured a great deal of hardship during 
          their first years of training: they were placed into situations and 
          drills that pushed their abilities to their very limit and beyond. 
          Their hard training was complemented with high-level education, which 
          included mathematics, science, physics, reading, writing, and military 
          tactics

        <h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence (CINCONI)</h3>
        <p>
          The primary head of ONI is the Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval 
          Intelligence (CINCONI). Osman, a former SPARTAN-II herself, currently possesses
           near-complete operational control over ONI and through it much of the UNSC.
            Although ONI employs a number of security councils and numerous 
           checks and balances within the organization proper, the CINCONI maintains the greatest 
           singular power within ONI and, in many respects, the entirety of human governance.
