      <p>
        The SPARTAN-II Program, originally known as the ORION Project
        Generation II, was part of the SPARTAN Program, an effort to produce
        elite soldiers through mechanical and biological augmentation.
        The SPARTAN-II program would be the first in the series to meld
        advanced exoskeleton technology with the soldiers' superior physiques.

      <h3>Spartan Variants</h3>
      <p>
        There are four variants of Spartans. Each variant was seen as an upgrade to previous iterations.
        For instance the <a href="#ORIONS">Orion's</a> are considered the SPARTAN I class but they
        lacked both the advanced MJONIR armor and the physical and mental augmentations that became
        standard for later Spartan variants. Save for the controversial <a href="#SPARTAN III">Spartan III's </a>
        variant which saw the deployment of the youngest soldiers in UNSC history. <a href="#Spartan II">Spartan
          II's</a>
        are regarded as the most effective class of Spartan. The legendary Master Chief; John 117 is among the first
        class of the Spartan II's. Lastly are the <a href="#Spartan IV">Spartan IV's</a>. Less effective than II's
        but they are greater in number and armed with the most advanced MJONIR armor.

      <h4>Spartan Training</h4>
      <p>
        Orion and Spartan IV classes were made up of volunteers from UNSC Special Forces.
        The SPARTAN-II candidates, after being abducted and sedated, were taken
        to the colony world Reach, and began their training under Chief Petty
        Officer Mendez. The SPARTANs endured a great deal of hardship during
        their first years of training: they were placed into situations and
        drills that pushed their abilities to their very limit and beyond.
        Their hard training was complemented with high-level education, which
        included mathematics, science, physics, reading, writing, and military
        tactics

      <h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence (CINCONI)</h3>
      <p>
        The primary head of ONI is the Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval
        Intelligence (CINCONI). Osman, a former SPARTAN-II herself, currently possesses
        near-complete operational control over ONI and through it much of the UNSC.
        Although ONI employs a number of security councils and numerous checks and balances
        within the organization proper, the CINCONI maintains the greatest singular power
        within ONI and, in many respects, the entirety of human governance.
