          <a>The Office of Naval Intelligence is responsible for UNSC 
            signals intelligence (SIGINT), human intelligence (HUMINT),
             counter-espionage, propaganda, and top-secret research and 
             development programs. The agency mostly operates 
             independently of other UNSC branches, and at times it 
             contravenes the law and UNSC protocol to complete 
             top-secret missions. </a>.

        <h3>Planet Reach: Home to ONI headquarters</h3>
        <p>
          Reach is a human colony world in the Epsilon Eridani system, 
          located within the Inner colonies. The planet was originally 
          colonized in 2362 by the Odyssey for its rich titanium deposits.
           The mines all over the planet ran thousands of meters deep. ONI's 
           CASTLE Base was located in one of these mines underneath Menachite 
           Mountain. The Office of Naval Intelligence commandeered the mine after
            it breached a secret complex beneath Reach's surface. This facility 
            was also the birthplace of the legendary SPARTAN-II Program.

        <h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence (CINCONI)</h3>
        <p>
          The primary head of ONI is the Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval 
          Intelligence (CINCONI). Osman, a former SPARTAN-II herself, currently possesses
           near-complete operational control over ONI and through it much of the UNSC.
            Although ONI employs a number of security councils and numerous 
           checks and balances within the organization proper, the CINCONI maintains the greatest 
           singular power within ONI and, in many respects, the entirety of human governance.
