        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The SPARTAN-II Program, originally known as the ORION Project 
            Generation II, was part of the SPARTAN Program, an effort to produce 
            elite soldiers through mechanical and biological augmentation. 
            The SPARTAN-II program would be the first in the series to meld 
            advanced exoskeleton technology with the soldiers' superior physiques.

            <h4>Spartan Variants</h4>
            <p>
            The Spartan program developed multiple variants of spartan classes over the years. The latest is the Spartan IV program.
            Like the original ORION Project, the SPARTAN-IV program utilizes consenting adult volunteers selected from the other branches
            of the United Nations Space Command, in contrast to the previous two programs which used children as candidates.[5 Recruits 
            are drawn from both career military veterans and young soldiers who show considerable promise

        <h3>Office of Naval Intelligence </h3>
        <p>
        Following the war, the Office of Naval Intelligence had become the primary intelligence service of the UEG 
        with nearly uncontested power in this field. ONI was also afforded a great deal of autonomy, due to its 
        connections with the UNSC Security Council.As of 2555, Admiral Margaret Parangosky was replaced with Admiral 
        Serin Osman as Commander-in-Chief.By 2558, ONI had a liason with the HIGHCOM Security Committee.
        During The Reclamation, ONI teams sanitized data on Earth.[12] As well, CINCONI Serin Osman went 
        into hiding, along with Fleet Admiral Terrence Hood.[

        <h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval Intelligence (CINCONI)</h3>
        <p>
        The primary head of ONI is the Commander-in-Chief of the Office of Naval 
        Intelligence (CINCONI). Osman, a former SPARTAN-II herself, currently possesses
        near-complete operational control over ONI and through it much of the UNSC.
        Although ONI employs a number of security councils and numerous 
        checks and balances within the organization proper, the CINCONI maintains the greatest 
        singular power within ONI and, in many respects, the entirety of human governance.
